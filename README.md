## FAQ

#### Is the project complete and functional?

**Yup**, pretty much! The only missing feature is the setup of an admin account inside the application and the implementation of a non-local database. 


#### Are you planning on updating this project?

This is just a practice exercise that is aimed to see what we can produce within six hours of development. It is highly unlikely that we will update the project but there is a chance in the far future.
